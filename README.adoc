* PlanWithEase (PWE) is a degree planner desktop application. It has a GUI but most of the user
interactions happen
using a CLI
(Command Line Interface).
* PWE is designed to help students in National University of Singapore(NUS) Information Security freshmen in creating a
 comprehensive degree plan according to the degree requirements.
* PWE is optimized for those who prefer using a CLI. The commands used to interact with PWE
are designed to be simple and intuitive, so even those who are unfamiliar with CLI can use PWE with ease.

* PWE allows users to:
** plan their module quickly and more conveniently.
** automate checking of module pre-requisites to avoid module conflicts. _(coming soon)_
** provide an informed decision so that the user are able to decide which module to take at which semester.
