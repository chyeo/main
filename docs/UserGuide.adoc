Format: `list`

==== Finding modules : `find` image:https://img.shields.io/badge/module-find-blue.svg[]

Having trouble locating the modules you want?

Make use of `find` command which allows you to find modules that have their names, code or credits matches the given
search criteria +
Format: `find [name/NAME] OPERATOR [code/CODE] OPERATOR [credits/CREDITS]`

When this command is used, the application will display only those modules which satisfy the search criteria.

The following table describes the valid prefixes that you can use to supply to the search criteria.
|====
| *Prefix* | *Description*
| `name/NAME` | Search for any module `name` which matches `NAME`
| `code/CODE` | Search for any module `code` which matches `CODE`
| `credits/CREDITS` | Search for any module `credits` which has `CREDITS`
|====

The following table describes the valid operators which you can to use supply to the search criteria.

|====
| *Operator* | *Description* | *Precedence*
| `&&` | Logical "AND" operation (both conditions A AND B must match) | Highest
| `\|\|` | Logical "OR" operation (either conditions A OR B must match)| Lowest
|====

The following examples describes how you could form a valid search criteria for the `find` command.

|====
| *Single Prefix Usage* | *Expected Result*
| `find name/NAME` | Returns modules containing `NAME` in their names
| `find code/CODE` |Returns modules containing `CODE` in their codes
| `find credits/CREDITS` | Returns modules having `CREDITS` in their credits
|====

If you need multiple prefixes, the following table shows you how you could do it.
 +
Note that you will need to separate multiple prefixes with an operator.
[TIP]
====
You could choose which search criteria having a higher priority by specifying parenthesis
====
|====
| *Multiple Prefix Usage* | *Expected Result*
| `find name/NAME1 && name/NAME2` | Returns modules containing both `NAME1` and `NAME2 in their names.
| `find name/NAME1 \|\| name/NAME2` | Returns modules containing both `NAME1` or `NAME2 in their names.
| `find name/NAME && code/CODE` | Returns modules containing `NAME` in their name and `CODE` in their codes.
| `find code/CODE \|\| (name/NAME && code/CODE2)` | Returns modules containing either `CODE` in their codes or `NAME`
in their names and `CODE2` in their codes.
|====

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `security` will match `Security`
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `CS` will not match `CS1231`
* The order of the prefixes does not matter. e.g. `find code/CODE || name/NAME` returns the same result as
`find name/NAME || code/CODE`
****
Examples:

* `find name/Security` +
Displays any modules having the word `security` (e.g. `security` and `Information Security`) in the module list.
* `find name/Information Security` +
Displays any modules having name with exact match  `Information Security` in the module list.
* `find code/CS1231 || code/CS2040`  +
Displays any modules having code `CS1231` or `CS2040` in the module list.
* `find credits/4 || credits/12` +
Displays any modules having credits `4` or `12` in the module list.
* `find name/Programming || code/CS1231` +
Displays any modules having name `Programming` or code `CS1231` in the module list.
* `find code/CS2113 || credits/4 && name/Programming` +
Displays any modules having name `Programming` and credits `4` or code `CS2113` in the module list.
* `find name/Programming && (code/CS1231 || code/CS1010)` +
Displays any modules having name `Programming` and code `CS1231` or code `CS1010` in the module list.

[TIP]
====
If you wish to search for module name with exact name `Information Security`, you could do so via the following command
 `find name/information security`

Do note that if you prefer to search for module name containing both `Information` and `Security` but in any order,
you can do the following command. `find name/Information && name/Security` +
This command will return you modules with both name keywords. (e.g. `Security in Information Privacy`)
====

==== Selecting modules : `select` image:https://img.shields.io/badge/module-select-blue.svg[]

Selects the module identified by the index number used in the displayed module list. +
