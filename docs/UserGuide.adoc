== Introduction

PlanWithEase (PWE) is an application designed to help National University of Singapore (NUS) Information Security freshmen in creating a comprehensive degree plan according to the degree requirements.

PWE is optimized for those who prefer using a Command Line Interface (CLI). The commands used to interact with PWE
are designed to be simple and intuitive, so even those who are unfamiliar with CLI can use PWE with ease.

PWE also comes with a clean Graphical User Interface (GUI) that presents information in an organized manner.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
.. e.g. in `add name/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter
which can be used as `add name/Programming Methodology`.
* Items in square brackets are optional parameters
** e.g. `name/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as:
.. `name/Database Systems tag/sql` (with optional `tag` parameter)
.. `name/Database Systems` (without optional `tag` parameter)
* Items with `…`​ after them are parameters that can be used multiple times (including zero times)
** e.g. `[tag/TAG]…` can be used as:
.. `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times)
.. `tag/programming` (i.e. 1 time)
.. `tag/programming tag/algorithms`, etc.  (i.e. many times)
** e.g. `[name/NAME NAME…]` can be used as:
.. `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times)
.. `name/Programming` (i.e. 1 time)
.. `name/Programming Methodology`, etc.  (i.e. many times)
* Prefixed-parameters can be arranged in any order after all non-prefixed parameters (if any)
** e.g. if the command specifies `INDEX name/NAME code/CODE`:
.. entering `INDEX code/CODE name/NAME` is also acceptable
.. entering `name/NAME INDEX code/CODE` is not acceptable

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a module: `add`

Adds a module to the module list. +
Format: `add code/CODE name/NAME credits/CREDITS [coreq/COREQUISITE]… [tag/TAG]…`

* `CODE` indicates the module code (e.g. `CS1010`).
* `NAME` indicates the name of the module (e.g. `Programming Methodology`).
* `CREDITS` indicates the modular credits assigned to the module (e.g. `004`).
* `COREQUISITE` indicates the module code that is a co-requisite of the module to be added.
* `TAG` indicates the extra information to associate the module with (e.g. `programming`, `loops`).

[WARNING]
====
`CODE`, `NAME`, `CREDITS`, and `TAG`/`COREQUISITE` (if specified) must not be empty. +
`CODE` should begin with two alphabets, followed by four digits, and may optionally end with an alphabet. +
`CODE` is case insensitive, and is treated as uppercase (e.g. `cs1010` is treated as `CS1010`), and should be unique. +
`NAME` should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces +
`CREDITS` should only contain whole numbers between 0 and 999 (both inclusive). +
`TAG` should only a single word containing alphanumeric characters. +
`COREQUISITE` follows the same format as `CODE`.
====

Example:

* `add code/CS1010 name/Programming Methodology credits/4 tag/programming tag/algorithms tag/c tag/imperative` +
Adds a module named `Programming Methodology` with module code `CS1010`, which is assigned `4` modular credits, to the module list. This module also has the tags `programming`, `algorithms`, `c`, `imperative`.

[TIP]
A module can have any number of tags (including 0)

Example: +

* `add code/CS1231 credits/4 name/Discrete Structures`

[WARNING]
====
When adding a module with a corequisite, if the module is added successfully, the co-requisite modules will be updated as well.
====

Example: +

* `add code/CS2113T name/Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Programming credits/4 coreq/CS2101` +
Adds a module named `Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Programming` with module code `CS2113T`, which is
assigned `4` modular credits and has module code `CS2101` as a corequisite, to the module list. This module also has
the tags `sweng`, `java`. +
Both `CS2113T` and `CS2101` will be updated to be co-requisites.

=== Listing all modules : `list`

Shows a list of all modules in the module list. +
Format: `list`

=== Editing a module : `edit`

Edits an existing module in the module list. +
Format: `edit INDEX [name/NAME] [code/CODE] [credits/CREDITS] [tag/TAG]… [coreq/COREQUISITE]…`

[NOTE]
====
* Edits the module at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number (beside the module code) shown in the displayed module list.
* You need to provide at least one of the optional fields to edit.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags/corequisites, the existing tags/corequisites of the module will be removed (i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.)
* You can remove all the module's tags by typing `tag/` without specifying any tags after it.
* Likewise, you can remove all module's co-requisites by typing `coreq/` without specifying any codes after it.
====

Examples:

* `edit 1 name/Data Structures and Algorithms code/CS2040C` +
Edits the name and code of the 1st module in the displayed module list to be `Data Structures and Algorithms` and `CS2040C` respectively. +
* `edit 2 code/CS2040C tag/` +
Edits the code of the 2nd module in the displayed module list to be `CS2040C` and clears all existing tags associated
 with the module. +
* `edit 3 coreq/CS1010` +
Edits the co-requisite of the 3rd module in the displayed module list to be `CS1010`. +
* `edit 4 coreq/CS2105 coreq/CS2106 coreq/CS2107` +
Edits the co-requisites of the 4rd module in the displayed module list to be `CS2105`, `CS2106` and `CS2107`. +

=== Find modules with name/code/credit: `find`

Having trouble locating the modules you want?

Make use of `find` command which allows you to find modules that have their names, code or credits matches the given
search criteria +
Format: `find [name/NAME] OPERATOR [code/CODE] OPERATOR [credits/CREDITS]`

When this command is used, the application will display only those modules which satisfy the search criteria.

The following table describes the valid prefixes that you can use to supply to the search criteria.
|====
| *Prefix* | *Description*
| `name/NAME` | Search for any module `name` which matches `NAME`
| `code/CODE` | Search for any module `code` which matches `CODE`
| `credits/CREDITS` | Search for any module `credits` which has `CREDITS`
|====

The following table describes the valid operators which you can to use supply to the search criteria.

|====
| *Operator* | *Description* | *Precedence*
| `&&` | Logical "AND" operation (both conditions A AND B must match) | Highest
| `\|\|` | Logical "OR" operation (either conditions A OR B must match)| Lowest
|====

The following examples describes how you could form a valid search criteria for the `find` command.

|====
| *Single Prefix Usage* | *Expected Result*
| `find name/NAME` | Returns modules containing `NAME` in their names
| `find code/CODE` |Returns modules containing `CODE` in their codes
| `find credits/CREDITS` | Returns modules having `CREDITS` in their credits
|====

If you need multiple prefixes, the following table shows you how you could do it.
 +
Note that you will need to separate multiple prefixes with an operator.
[TIP]
====
You could choose which search criteria having a higher priority by specifying parenthesis
====
|====
| *Multiple Prefix Usage* | *Expected Result*
| `find name/NAME1 && name/NAME2` | Returns modules containing both `NAME1` and `NAME2 in their names.
| `find name/NAME1 \|\| name/NAME2` | Returns modules containing both `NAME1` or `NAME2 in their names.
| `find name/NAME && code/CODE` | Returns modules containing `NAME` in their name and `CODE` in their codes.
| `find code/CODE \|\| (name/NAME && code/CODE2)` | Returns modules containing either `CODE` in their codes or `NAME`
in their names and `CODE2` in their codes.
|====

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `security` will match `Security`
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `CS` will not match `CS1231`
* The order of the prefixes does not matter. e.g. `find code/CODE || name/NAME` returns the same result as
`find name/NAME ||
code/CODE`
****
Examples:

* `find name/Security` +
Displays any modules having the word `security` (e.g. `security` and `Information Security`) in the module list.
* `find name/Information Security` +
Displays any modules having name with exact match  `Information Security` in the module list.
* `find code/CS1231 || code/CS2040`  +
Displays any modules having code `CS1231` or `CS2040` in the module list.
* `find credits/4 || credits/12` +
Displays any modules having credits `4` or `12` in the module list.
* `find name/Programming || code/CS1231` +
Displays any modules having name `Programming` or code `CS1231` in the module list.
* `find code/CS2113 || credits/4 && name/Programming` +
Displays any modules having name `Programming` and credits `4` or code `CS2113` in the module list.
* `find name/Programming && (code/CS1231 || code/CS1010)` +
Displays any modules having name `Programming` and code `CS1231` or code `CS1010` in the module list.

[TIP]
====
If you wish to search for module name with exact name `Information Security`, you could do so via the following command
 `find name/information security`

Do note that if you prefer to search for module name containing both `Information` and `Security` but in any order,
you can do the following command. `find name/Information && name/Security` +
This command will return you modules with both name keywords. (e.g. `Security in Information Privacy`)
====
