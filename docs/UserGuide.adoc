[NOTE]
====
Don't worry if you don't understand everything at once. +
There are plentiful examples provided to aid your understanding of the commands' usage better.
====

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
** e.g. in `add name/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter
which can be used as:
.. `add name/Programming Methodology`
.. `add name/Web Security`
* Items in square brackets are optional parameters
** e.g. `name/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as:
.. `name/Database Systems tag/sql` (with optional `tag` parameter)
.. `name/Database Systems` (without optional `tag` parameter)
* Items with `…`​ after them are parameters that can be used multiple times (including zero times)
** e.g. `[tag/TAG]…` can be used as:
.. `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times)
.. `tag/programming` (i.e. 1 time)
.. `tag/programming tag/algorithms`, etc.  (i.e. many times)
** e.g. `[name/NAME NAME…]` can be used as:
.. `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times)
.. `name/Programming` (i.e. 1 time)
.. `name/Programming Methodology`, etc.  (i.e. many times)
* Prefixed-parameters can be arranged in any order after all non-prefixed parameters (if any)
** e.g. if the command specifies `INDEX name/NAME code/CODE`:
.. entering `INDEX code/CODE name/NAME` is also acceptable, but
.. entering `name/NAME INDEX code/CODE` is *not acceptable*

[WARNING]

|======
// end::module_management[]

// tag::module_add[]
==== Adding modules : `add` image:https://img.shields.io/badge/module-add-blue.svg[]

Before you can add modules to the *degree plan*, you'll need to add modules into the *module list* first. +
It's easy to add a module into the *module list*! Here's how you can use the `add` command.

*Command Format:* `add code/CODE name/NAME credits/CREDITS [sem/SEMESTER]… [coreq/COREQUISITE]… [tag/TAG]…`

[WARNING]
====
Please note that you cannot add a new module which has a co-requisite module already existing in the *degree plan*. +
You'll need to remove the module from the *degree plan* first before you can add the new module in with the co-requisite module specified.
====

*Example:*

* `add code/GEH1074 name/Luck credits/4 sem/1 sem/2` +
Adds a module named `Luck` with module code `GEH1074`, which is assigned `4` modular credits and is offered in semesters `1` and `2`, to the *module list*.

.New module "GEH1074 Luck" added to *module list* successfully
ifdef::env-github[]
image::module_add_luck.png[width=800]
endif::[]

ifndef::env-github[]
image::module_add_luck.png[width=970]
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
When adding a module with a corequisite, if the module is added successfully, the co-requisite modules will be updated as well.
====

*Example:* +

* `add name/Skills code/GEH1074T credits/4 sem/1 sem/2 coreq/GEH1074 tag/GEM tag/economics` +
Adds a module named `Skills` with module code `GEH1074T`, which is assigned `4` modular credits and has module code `GEH1074` as a corequisite, to the module list. +
Both modules (`GEH1074T` and `GEH1074`) will be updated to be co-requisites as shown below.

.Module GEH1074T is added successfully; GEH1074T and GEH1074 are now co-requisites.
ifdef::env-github[]
image::module_add_coreq.png[width=800]
endif::[]

ifndef::env-github[]
image::module_add_coreq.png[width=970]
endif::[]

// end::module_add[]

// tag::module_edit[]
==== Editing modules : `edit` image:https://img.shields.io/badge/module-edit-blue.svg[]

Want to change the module details? No problem! +
You can use this handy `edit` command to update the module details to your liking.

*Command Format:* `edit INDEX [name/NAME] [code/CODE] [credits/CREDITS] [sem/SEMESTER]… [coreq/COREQUISITE]… [tag/TAG]…`

[NOTE]
====
* Edits the module at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number (beside the module code) shown in the displayed module list.
* You need to provide at least one of the optional fields to edit.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing semesters/corequisites/tags, the existing semesters/corequisites/tags of the module will be removed (i.e adding of semesters/corequisites/tags is not cumulative.)
* You can remove all the module's tags by typing `tag/` without specifying any tags after it.
* Likewise, you can remove all module's co-requisites or semesters by typing `coreq/` and `sem/` respectively without
 specifying any values after the parameter prefix.
====

Examples:

* `edit 1 name/Data Structures and Algorithms code/CS2040C` +
Edits the name and code of the 1^st^ module in the displayed module list to be `Data Structures and Algorithms` and
`CS2040C` respectively. +
* `edit 2 code/CS2040C tag/` +
Edits the code of the 2^nd^ module in the displayed module list to be `CS2040C` and clears all existing tags associated
 with the module. +
* `edit 3 coreq/CS2105 coreq/CS2106 coreq/CS2107` +
 Edits the co-requisites of the 3^rd^ module in the displayed module list to be `CS2105`, `CS2106` and `CS2107`. +

[NOTE]
====
Just like the `add` command, when editing the co-requisites of a module, the co-requisite modules will be updated as well.
====

*Example:* If `GEH1074` and `GEH1074T` are not co-requisites, running the command `edit 24 coreq/GEH1074T` will
result in GEH1074 and GEH1074T being co-requisites.

.GEH1074 and GEH1074T are being edited to be co-requisites.

// end::module_edit[]

// tag::module_delete[]
==== Deleting modules : `delete` image:https://img.shields.io/badge/module-delete-blue.svg[]

Want to delete a module from the *module list*? Simply locate the module to be deleted in the *module list*, and
then use the `delete` command!

*Command Format:* `delete INDEX`

[NOTE]
====
To choose which module you want to delete, include the index number (beside the module code) in the displayed module list.
====

[WARNING]
====
* The deleted module will be removed from both the requirement category assigned and the degree plan (where applicable).
* Any modules with the deleted module as a co-requisite will be updated accordingly (i.e. deleted module is removed from the respective module's co-requisite list).
====

*Example:*
If `GET1074T` and `GET1074` are co-requisite modules, deleting `GET1074` will cause `GET1074` 's list of co-requisite
 modules to be updated as well.

.`GET1074` is removed from `GET1074` 's list of co-requisites.

// tag::find[]
==== Finding modules : `find` image:https://img.shields.io/badge/module-find-blue.svg[]

Having trouble locating the modules you want?

Make use of `find` command which allows you to find modules that have their names, code or credits matching the given
search criteria.

*Command Format:* `find [name/NAME] OPERATOR [code/CODE] OPERATOR [credits/CREDITS]`

When this command is used, the application will display only those modules which satisfy the search criteria.

The following table describes the valid prefixes that you can supply to the search criteria.
|====
| *Prefix* | *Description*
| `name/NAME` | Search for any module `name` which matches `NAME`
| `code/CODE` | Search for any module `code` which matches `CODE`
| `credits/CREDITS` | Search for any module `credits` which has `CREDITS`
| `tag/TAG` | Search for any module `tag` which matches `TAG`
| `sem/SEMESTER` | Search for any module that is being offered in `SEMESTER`
|====

The following table describes the valid operators which you can supply to the search criteria.

|====
| *Operator* | *Description* | *Precedence*
| `&&` | Logical "AND" operation (both conditions A AND B must match) | Highest
| `\|\|` | Logical "OR" operation (either conditions A OR B must match)| Lowest
a| `(` and `)` | Search term surrounded by parenthesis will always be evaluated first. If there is a tie, the logical
operator precedence will be taken into consideration. | N.A
|====

The following examples describes how you could form a valid search criteria for the `find` command.

|====
| *Single Prefix Usage* | *Expected Result*
| `find name/NAME` | Returns modules containing `NAME` in their names
| `find code/CODE` |Returns modules containing `CODE` in their codes
| `find credits/CREDITS` | Returns modules having `CREDITS` in their credits
|====

If you need multiple prefixes, the following table shows some examples on how it can be done.
 +
Note that you will need to separate multiple prefixes with an operator.
[TIP]
====
You could choose which search criteria having a higher priority by specifying parenthesis
====
|====
| *Multiple Prefix Usage* | *Expected Result*
| `find name/NAME1 && name/NAME2` | Returns modules containing both `NAME1` and `NAME2` in their names.
| `find name/NAME1 \|\| name/NAME2` | Returns modules containing both `NAME1` or `NAME2` in their names.
| `find name/NAME && code/CODE` | Returns modules containing `NAME` in their name and `CODE` in their codes.
| `find code/CODE \|\| (name/NAME && code/CODE2)` | Returns modules containing either `CODE` in their codes or `NAME`
in their names and `CODE2` in their codes.
|====

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `security` will match `Security`
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `CS` will not match `CS1231`
* The order of the prefixes does not matter. e.g. `find code/CODE || name/NAME` returns the same result as
`find name/NAME || code/CODE`
****
Examples:

* `find name/computer` +
Displays all modules with names containing the word `computer` (e.g. `computer` and `Computer Security`) in the module
list.

[TIP]
====
If you wish to search for module name with exact name `Information Security`, you could do so via the following command
 `find name/information security`

Do note that if you prefer to search for module name containing both `Information` and `Security` but in any order,
you can do the following command. `find name/Information && name/Security` +
This command will return you modules with both name keywords. (e.g. `Security in Information Privacy`)
====
// end::find[]

==== Listing all modules : `list` image:https://img.shields.io/badge/module-list-blue.svg[]

Shows a list of all modules in the *module list*. +
*Command Format:* `list`

[TIP]
====
This command is useful if you want to display all modules in the *module list* after doing a `find` command.
====

*Example:* Running the `list` command:

.All modules are displayed in the *module list*.

==== Showing semesters based on year/semester: `planner_show` image:https://img.shields.io/badge/planner-show-F17D3F.svg[]

Having trouble locating semesters you want? +
Simply use `planner_show` command. It will only show you the semesters you want to see. +

*Command Format:* `planner_list [y/YEAR] OPERATOR [s/SEMESTER`]

When this command is used, the application will display only those semesters which satisfy the search criteria.

The following table describes the valid prefixes that you can use to supply to the search criteria.
|====
| *Prefix* | *Description*
| `year/YEAR` | Search for any semester `year` which matches `YEAR`
| `sem/SEMESTER` | Search for any semester `sem` which matches `SEMESTER`
|====

The following table describes the valid operators which you can to use supply to the search criteria.

|====
| *Operator* | *Description* | *Precedence*
| `&&` | Logical "AND" operation (both conditions A AND B must match) | Highest
| `\|\|` | Logical "OR" operation (either conditions A OR B must match)| Lowest
|====

The following examples describes how you could form a valid search criteria for the `planner_show` command.

|====
| *Single Prefix Usage* | *Expected Result*
| `planner_show year/YEAR` | Shows only semesters that are in year `YEAR`
| `planner_show sem/SEMESTER` | Shows only semesters that are in semester `SEMESTER`
|====

If you need multiple prefixes, the following table shows you how you could do it.
 +
Note that you will need to separate multiple prefixes with an operator.
[TIP]
====
You could choose which search criteria having a higher priority by specifying parenthesis
====
|====
| *Multiple Prefix Usage* | *Expected Result*
| `planner_show year/YEAR1 \|\| year/YEAR2` | Shows only semesters that are in years `YEAR1` or `YEAR2`.
| `planner_show sem/SEMESTER1 \|\| sem/SEMESTER2` | Shows only semesters that are in semester `SEMESTER1`
or `SEMESTER`.
| `planner_show sem/SEMESTER && (year/YEAR1 \|\| year/YEAR2)` | Shows only semesters that are in year `YEAR1`
semester `SEMESTER` or `YEAR2` semester `SEMESTER`.
|====

****
* The order of the prefixes does not matter. e.g. `planner_show sem/SEMESTER || year/YEAR` returns the same result as
`planner_show year/YEAR || sem/SEMESTER`
****
*Examples:*

* `planner_show year/1` +
Shows any semesters having the year `1` (e.g. `Year 1 Semester 1`, `Year 1 Semester 2` ...) in the degree plan.
* `planner_show sem/1` +
Shows any semesters having the year `1` (e.g. `Year 1 Semester 1`, `Year 2 Semester 1` ...) in the degree plan.
* `planner_show year/1 || year/2`  +
Shows any semesters having the year `1` or year `2` in the degree plan.
* `planner_show sem/1 || sem/2` +
Shows any semesters having the semester `1` or semester `2` in the degree plan.
* `planner_show year/1 && sem/1` +
Shows a semester having the year `1` and semester `1` (e.g. `Year 1 Semester 1`)in the degree plan.
* `planner_show sem/1 && (year/1 || year/2)` +
Shows a semester having the year `1` semester `1` and  year `2` semester `1` (e.g. `Year 1 Semester 1` and `Year 2
Semester 2`) in the degree plan.

//tag::planner-suggest[]
==== Using degree plan to suggest modules : `planner_suggest` image:https://img.shields.io/badge/planner-suggest-F17D3F.svg[]

Having trouble identifying modules to add to the *degree plan*? +
Make use of `planner_suggest` command to find out recommended modules to add to the *degree plan*. +

*Command Format:* `planner_suggest credits/CREDITS [tag/TAG]…`

When this command is successfully executed, the *result box* will display modules recommended.

[NOTE]
====
* *Maximum 10* modules are recommended in the recommendation list.
* In addition to the recommendation list, supplementary information on the specific modules with matching tags and credits
is given as two additional lists. The modules in the two additional lists are all from the recommendation list.
* Modules recommended in all 3 aforementioned lists are sorted according to the following criteria:
** For modules with different number of tags that match the desirable tags (matching tags), modules with more matching
tags will be sorted to the front of the list.
** If modules have the same number of matching tags but different credits, modules with the credits closer to the
desirable credits will be sorted to the front of the list.
** If modules have the same number of matching tags and credits, they will be sorted according to alphabetical
order.
** If `tag/TAG` is not supplied as a parameter in the command, modules will be sorted according to credits and alphabetical order only.
* All modules in the recommendation list and the two additional lists are modules not found in the degree plan.
====

*Examples:*

* `planner_suggest credits/4` +
Suggests maximum 10 modules not found in the degree plan, prioritizing modules with credits closer to 4. If tie,
prioritizes according to alphabetical order.

* `planner_suggest credits/2 tag/algorithms` +
Suggests maximum 10 modules not found in the degree plan, prioritizing modules with tag `algorithms`. If tie, prioritizes
according to credits closer to 2. If tie again, prioritizes according to alphabetical order.
